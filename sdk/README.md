# Airembr SDK

AiRembr SDK is a software development kit that enables developers to easily store, retrieve, and manage data within the
AiRembr memory system. It provides a seamless interface for integrating AiRembr’s real-time, memory into any
application—allowing AI agents, enterprise systems, and intelligent apps to capture observations,
query contextual memories, and evolve knowledge structures with minimal latency.

# What is AiRembr?

AiRembr is a neuroplastic, neurosymbolic memory system designed for next-generation AI. It captures, synthesizes, and
evolves data in real time, enabling large language models to store and retrieve observations with latency under 20 ms.
Built for enterprise-grade performance, AiRembr bridges machine learning and symbolic reasoning to create adaptive,
intelligent memories that continuously learn and restructure themselves.

With its API-first architecture, AiRembr integrates seamlessly into existing infrastructures, connecting to diverse
data sources—from emails and databases to live webhooks. Whether powering AI agents, customer data platforms, or
healthcare systems, AiRembr transforms static models into context-aware, evolving intelligences that understand, adapt,
and remember.
